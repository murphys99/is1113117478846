                <h1><strong><u> What is the cloud?</u></strong></h1>
                <p class="cloud">Cloud computing is an information technology (IT) paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility.
        
        Third-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance. Advocates note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand. Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.
        
        Since the launch of Amazon EC2 in 2006, the availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing.</p>

              <h1>CaaS</h1>
              
              <br>
              <br>
              
              <p>The Caas Vendor is responsible for all the hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). This simply allows organizations to selectively deploy new communication methods as they go, on a pay-as-you-go or as needed basis. This eliminates the large capital investment a lot of companies would've done before which would of left them worse off often spending more or falling sort for what is needed to be done.</p>
              
              <p>CaaS offers flexibility and the possibility of expanding for small-medium enterprises that they may not otherwise be able to afford. Using CaaS means you are always able to adapt and change to suit your needs meaning that the system will never go obselete requiring major costly upgrades</p>

              <p>PaaS is the complete development and deployment method in the cloud. PaaS allows you to develop simple cloud-based apps to major enterprise apps.</p>
              <p>Like most other cloud services a major positive is the reduction in cost, with PaaS you avoid the costs of software licences, developer tools and so on. The cloud provider usually managers this other stuff.</p>
              <p>There are many positives of PaaS. One example would be develop for many platforms easily. Some service providers give you development options for multiple platforms, such as computers, mobile devices, and browsers making cross-platform apps quicker and easier to develop.</p>
              <p> An example of PaaS is Cloud 9</p>

   <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).</p>
   <p>SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support.</p>

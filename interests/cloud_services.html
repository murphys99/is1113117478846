	    <h1><u>Why I'm so Interested in Cloud Services?</u></h1>
	    <p>There are so many benefits to using the cloud. I will explain these now and tell you about my favourite uses for these cloud services
	    
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    
	    Most of us use the cloud services most days without even noticing, for example most people will log into their email each day to receive and send emails, what most people dont know is that in fact this is a cloud service! It allows you to send and view emails anywhere in the world. An example is Gmail!
	    
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    
	    In the next slides I will tell you more about my keen interests in the cloud services available today
	    
	    </p>

	<div class="section" id="section2">
		<h2><u>Storage</u></h2>
	<p>Nearly all our data is saved online nowadays. Everyday I use the cloud to store files. For me iCloud is extremely useful day to day as I use it to store photos and I can access them then on my iPhone or iPad anywhere,
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Another platform I use frequently is Google drive. I used this a lot in secondary school when studying for the LC. I used to save files such a wordocs on the google drive so I could access them in school or at home.
	This eliminates the use of the USB and diminishes the risks of losing the USB along with your files.
	
	</p>
	
	
	</div>
	<div class="section" id="section3"><h3><u>Backup & Recovery</u></h3>
       
        <p>Backing up data is easier than ever now thanks to the cloud! Everytime we connect to iTunes we are backing up our phones and this is a storage incase your phone is ever lost or destroyed. This makes it so easy to get all your data back in an instant.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        I am constantly backing up my iPhone and iPad to ensure that if they ever become damaged I wont lose all my files for ever that were on my phone and I can
        simly recover them all from iTunes in a number of minutes as if I never lost any data.
